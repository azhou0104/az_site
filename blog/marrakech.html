    <h1>
      Marrakech, Morocco
    </h1>
    <p>And so, here I was at my laptop, scouring Google, trying to find the cheapest way to get from Seville to Madrid. However, in my desperate search, I spotted a $20 flight to Marrakesh from Seville, and then a $50 flight back from Marrakesh to Madrid. Of course, this was probably the least cheap and most roundabout way to get from Seville to Madrid, but when else would I have the opportunity to hop on a $20 flight to Africa? So, in my mission to find the cheapest route from southern to middle Spain, I ended up spending $120 — the extra $50 being the fee I had to pay for carry-on luggage, because RyanAir apparently hates broke people. </p>

    <p>
      My friend Ali and I landed in Morocco in the quiet of the early morning. We were dropped off in the center of the Medina — Marrakesh's maze-like conglomeration of souks (shops), packed tightly in a series of winding dirt pathways. At this hour, though, the souks hadn't opened yet, so we walked past alley upon alley of tan wooden doors. When we finally arrived at our hostel, the receptionist promised that at 10 am, the souk doors would open, and colors would burst through.
    </p>

    <p>Though, of course, Ali and I couldn't wait until then and decided to take a 40-minute walk through Marrakesh to catch a glimpse of the Jardin Majorelle, a garden designed by Yves Saint Laurent. Candidly, I'd give the gardens a 7/10 — pretty enough to make it worth it if you have time to kill. It was a bit of a tourist trap, and we waited in line for over 20 minutes just to walk through the garden in another orderly line. But it was full of cacti and bamboo, and the most beautiful shade of blue. The structures inside the garden were all painted with an opaque coat of the bluest blue. I soon came to learn that Marrakech was covered in this beautiful electric cobalt blue. Of course, my iPhone had no chance of capturing this color justice..</p>

    <p>We got lost in the sauce on our way home. We made a pit stop at a shoe store, where Ali bought fake Yeezys and Stan Smiths for a total of $40 USD. It was a steal and a half and also a bit more, considering his $20 Stan Smiths were practically indistinguishable from my authentic $100 Stan Smiths, to the point where even the print on the bottom of the shoe was identical. Donning his new Yeezy's, Ali and I made our way to Jemaa el-Fna Square, which is literally a large square, similar to a marketplace. The difference was that it was full of snake charmers playing pungis and their cobras, henna stands, and a monkey on a leash. I was afraid to ogle too long at the snake charmers: firstly, because I'm terrified of snakes, and secondly, because they would start charging you if you looked too interested. </p>

    <h2> The Medina </h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned before, the Medina is Marrakech's personal labyrinth of winding narrow alleys that are completely packed with shops. The souks sold everything: mother-of-pearl chessboards, spices and pigments, stained glass lamps, exquisite rugs, and trinkets of all sorts. My inner shopaholic was certainly appeased.


    </p>
    <p>
      The Medina was chaotic and easy to get lost in — the narrow dirt roads were only a couple of meters wide and catered to the congested traffic of pedestrians and motorbikers alike. The sounds of engines starting and stopping as the bikers dodged the walkers mixed seamlessly into the voices of shopkeepers luring tourists into their stands — it made for a cacophonous and adrenaline-fueled environment. The picture below was captured during the later hours when the traffic had slowed down.

    <h2>Mountains & Camels</h2>
    <p>Now for the part of Morocco that I was most ecstatic about: CAMELS! We had booked a day trip to the Atlas Mountains and Agafay Desert, which were about a 2-hour drive from Marrakech. In the Agafay Desert, we rode camels. They were much larger than I had imagined, had skinny knobbly knees, and killer eyelashes. I resisted the urge to ask them for their lash routine — they were so long and lush, and they accentuated the camel's large eyes. Atop the camel, I juggled between holding my phone and camera in each hand and holding onto the harness for my life. </p>

    <p>Afterwards, the tour guides took us to a shop that made argan oil (Morocco is renowned for it!). I watched the ladies grind argan kernels around and around. Of course, I had to pick up a bottle for my hair because I've dyed it so many times, and I'm willing to put just about anything in it to keep it from looking like hay.</p>
