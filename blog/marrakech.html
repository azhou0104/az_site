    <h1>
      Marrakech, Morocco
    </h1>
    <p>And so here I was at my laptop, scouring Google trying to find the cheapest way to get from Seville to Madrid.
      However in my desperate search, I spotted a $20 flight to Marrakesh from Seville, and then a $50 flight back from
      Marrakesh to Madrid. Of course this was probably the least cheap and most roundabout way to get from Seville to
      Madrid, but when else am I going to have the opportunity to hop on a $20 flight to Africa? So in my mission to
      find the cheapest route from southern to middle Spain, I spent $120 — the extra $50 being the fee I had to pay for
      carryon luggage, because RyanAir apparently hates broke people. </p>

    <p>
      My friend Ali and I landed in Morocco in the quiet of the early morning. We were dropped off in the center of the
      Medina — Marrakesh's maze-like conglomeration of souks (shops), packed tightly in a series of winding dirt
      pathways. At this hour though, the souks haven't opened yet, so we walked past alley upon alley of tan wooden
      doors. When we finally arrived at our hostel though, the receptionist promised that soon at 10am the souk doors
      would open and color would burst through.
    </p>

    <p>Though of course, Ali and I couldn't wait until then, and decided to make a 40 minute walk through Marrakesh to
      catch glimpse of the Jardin Majorelle, a garden designed by Yves Saint Laurent. Candidly, I'd give the gardens a
      7/10 — pretty enough to make it worth it if you have time to kill. It was a bit of a tourist trap, and we waited
      in line for over 20 minutes just to walk through the garden in another orderly line. But it was full of cactuses
      and bamboo, and the most beautiful color of blue. The structures inside the garden were all painted with an opaque
      coat of the bluest blue of blues. I soon came to learn that Marrakech was covered in this beautiful electric
      cobalt blue. Of course, my iPhone had no chance of doing this color justice.</p>

    <p> We got lost in the sauce on our way home. We made a pit-stop at a shoe store, where Ali bought fake Yeezys and
      Stan Smiths for $40 USD total. It was a steal and a half and also a bit more, considering his $20 Stan Smiths were
      practically indistinguishable from my authentic $100 Stan Smiths, to the point where even the print on the bottom
      of the shoe was identical. Donning his new Yeezy's, Ali and I made our way to Jemaa el-Fna Square, which is
      literally a large square, similar to a marketplace. The difference was that it was full of snake charmers playing
      pungis and their cobras, henna stands, and a monkey with a leash. I was afraid to oggle too long at the snake
      charmers: firstly because I'm terrified of snakes and secondly because they begin charging you if you look too
      interested. </p>

    <h2> The Medina </h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned before, the Medina is Marrakech's personal labyrinth of winding narrow alleys that are completely
      packed full of shops. The souks sold everything: mother-of-pearl chessboards, spices and pigments, stained glass
      lamps, exquisite rugs, and trinkets of all sorts. My inner shopaholic was certainly appeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Medina was chaotic and easy to get lost in — the narrow dirt roads were only a couple meters wide, and catered to
      the congested traffic of pedestrians and motorbikers alike. I was on high alert at all times, for fear that one
      mistep would indicate my foot getting ran over by a motorcycle wheel. The sounds of engines starting and stopping
      as the bikers dodged the walkers mixed seamelessly into the voices of hopeful shopkeepers luring into their stand
      — it made for a cacophonous and adrenalined environment. The picture below was captured during the later hours,
      when the traffic has slowed down.

    <h2>Mountains & Camels</h2>
    <p>Now for the part of Morocco that I was most ecstatic about: CAMELS! We had booked a daytrip to the Atlas
      Mountains and Agafay Desert, which were about a 2 hour drive out from Marrakech. In the Agafay Desert, we rode
      camels. They were much larger than I imagined, had skinny knobbly knees,and killer eyelashes. I resisted the urge
      to ask them for their lash rountine -- they were so long and lush, and they brought out the camel's large eyes.
      Atop the camel, I juggled between holding my phone and camera in each hand and holding onto the harness for my
      life. </p>

    <p>Afterwards, the tour guides took us to a shop that made argan oil (Morocco is renowned for it!). I watched the
      ladies
      grind argan kernels around and around. Of course I had to pick up a bottle for my hair because I've dyed it so
      many times and I'm willing to put just about anything in it to keep it from looking like hay.</p>
